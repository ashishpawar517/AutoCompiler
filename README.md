## What is AutoCompiler?
An automation project to solve compile-time errors on the fly. The idea started with an argument like if a compiler is smart enough to tell us that thereâ€™s a missing semi colon on line 17 then why is it can't just a semicolon there. That's what Autocompiler aims to do. See it in action.
